## About

This repository contains my personal solutions to various Codeforces problems. These solutions are written during practice sessions and contests as part of my competitive programming journey.

## Repository Structure

Each directory corresponds to a specific contest or problem set. Solutions within each directory are named by problem letter:
- `a.cpp`, `b.cpp`, `c.cpp`, etc. for C++ solutions
- `a.py`, `b.py`, `c.py`, etc. for Python solutions
